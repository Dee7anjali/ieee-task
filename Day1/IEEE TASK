1)What is the difference between em and rem units in CSS?
Ans : (a)em-Relative to the font size of the parent element.
      rem- Relative to the font size of the root element (<html>).
      (b)em: Useful for nested components where you want sizing to be relative to a parent’s font size.
      rem: Ideal for consistent sizing and spacing throughout a site, as it’s based on the root size.

2)Explain the concept of closures in JavaScript. Provide an example where a closure might be useful.(With code)
Ans : Closures in JavaScript let a function keep access to variables from its outer function even after the outer function has finished running. 
      This means the inner function can still use and modify those variables.
      CODE:
        function createCounter() {
  let count = 0; // `count` is a private variable

  return function() {
    count += 1; // Inner function accesses `count`
    return count;
  };
}

const counter = createCounter(); // `counter` is now a closure

console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
console.log(counter()); // 3

3)What are semantic HTML tags?
Semantic HTML tags provide meaning and structure to the web content by clearly defining its purpose. Unlike generic tags like <div> or <span>, 
  semantic tags describe their content, making it easier for browsers, search engines, and developers to understand the structure of the page.

Examples of Semantic HTML Tags:
<header>: Represents the introductory content or navigational links.
<footer>: Contains footer information, such as contact details or copyright.
<section>: Groups related content together, often with a heading.
<nav>: Indicates navigation links.
